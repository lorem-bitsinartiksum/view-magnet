''' The following is similar to a basic CD quality
   When CHUNK size is 4096 it routinely throws an IOError.
   When it is set to 8192 it doesn't.
   IOError happens due to the small CHUNK size

   What is CHUNK? Let's say CHUNK = 4096
   math.pow(2, 12) => RATE / CHUNK = 100ms = 0.1 sec

Different mics have different rates.
For example, Logitech HD 720p has rate 48000Hz
